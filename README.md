### I'm Aprian. 


I'm just a guy who'se (oops, meant "who's") interested in programming! 😄

Welcome to my coding journey! I'll be taking on the 100 days of coding challenge with Angela Yu's guidance. My main companion on this adventure will be Python, the language that can do pretty much anything 🐍

Throughout this challenge, I'll be diving into various Python applications, like:

🌐 Python for Web Development: Turning those lines of code into websites that even your grandma would be proud of!

📊 Python for Data Science: Unraveling the mysteries hidden within data, because who doesn't love a good data detective story?

🤖 Python for Automation: Letting Python do the boring stuff so I can focus on the important things, like deciding what to have for lunch.

🧠 Python for Machine Learning: Teaching machines to do things we're too lazy to do ourselves. Who's the real genius here, I wonder?

So, stay tuned as I embark on this Python-powered adventure, one code at a time. Who knows, maybe by the end of this journey 🐍.

It will involve various projects as each day I will be building lots of cool projects that I can add to my portfolio and also help me in my final year project (As of today 20/09/2023 I am still Studying - A finalist)



The days are set to help me realise how far I have come and I shouldn't stop learning and continue flexing my coding muscles. 😎

My personal logger where I will be recording my day-to-day activities as I learn different concepts on Python as I am currently interested in

- Full Stack Development (Web plus Android)
- Machine Learning
- Data Science 

So, as I venture forth into the Python-powered wilderness, let's remember: Every bug we squash brings us closer to that perfect code, and every late-night debugging session is just another step toward becoming the programming legends we were always meant to be!

Stay tuned for coding triumphs, epic fails, and moments of pure inspiration as we navigate through this jungle of curly braces and semicolons, making Python our trusty sidekick along the way. Together, we'll code the future, one "Hello, World!" at a time. 💻🌟

Update today 2nd september 2022 currently i'm on a trip, so I can't do anything but to keep the consistency going i'll just watch a few clips of Angela Yu :(

#### 3/09/2023
Update 3rd september, been on the boat all day and doing some procurement stuff definitely not  good 2 days :(

#### 19/09/2023
Starting to pick up the pace, just completed the Spotify project and boy was I happy when I complted it, because I just did it all by myself :) . making good progress

I just noticed that I don't document the things I learn for future reference, and it's not a good habit, therefore I'll try to compensate by documenting via the README files for each day starting from today and the day when I started learning about how to send automatic emails with python.
